# Cloud Computing Basics

## Introduction
This project is part of the "Introduction to Cloud Computing" assignment. It explores Microsoft Azure's free-tier account, uses the Azure Pricing Calculator to compare costs, and documents findings.

## Steps Taken
1. **Created an Azure Free Account**
   - Signed up for Microsoft Azure free tier.

2. **Used Azure Pricing Calculator**
   - Selected Virtual Machines 
   - Compared pricing across Central US, UK West, and Australia Central.
   - Screenshots of the Price for Virtual Machines across different region

- Screenshot of Virtual machine at Central US

## Lessons Learned
- Cloud pricing varies across different regions due to demand and infrastructure costs.
- Some regions are more expensive than others.
- The Azure Free Tier provides $200 credits for experimenting with services.
